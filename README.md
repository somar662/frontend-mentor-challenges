# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges. I'm using these projects to practice HTML and CSS, improve my frontend skills, and build a clean portfolio of work.

##  Folder Structure

Each challenge has its own folder with all the project files:
Inside each folder:
- `index.html` – the main HTML file
- `style.css` – the main stylesheet
- `README.md` – details about the challenge and my approach
- `images folder`
- `desktop and mobile screenshot`
