### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- HTML `<div>` elements for sectioning content  
- A mobile-first responsive design workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to structure a `<div>` by dividing it into multiple sections using layout techniques.

### Continued development

I used `float` and `width` to change the layout of the payment plan section.  
Next time, I plan to familiarize myself with **Flexbox** and use it to improve my layout in the next challenge.
